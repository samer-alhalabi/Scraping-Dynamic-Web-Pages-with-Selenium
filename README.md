# Web Scraping

#### What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. For more info visit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping

## Project 1: An app to scrape stocks data and send info to your inbox
Let's say you monitor stocks everyday and you want to check the day closing results by end of day and want it to be sent to your email. This script will do it for you.

Libraries: optional: [Selenium](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) 
required : [Beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
###### Note: In this app I used both, but you can use Beautifulsoup only to load the targeted webpage. Selenium will be helpful with the website navigation. Project 2 will show case.
